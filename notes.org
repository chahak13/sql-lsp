#+title: Notes

+ How are the arguments to functions decided?
+ We have a working formatter?
+ List of features that would be useful to support for SQL:
  - Completion (context aware, preferably?)
  - Query execution
  - [X] Query formatting
  - [X] Function/keyword help? on hover? Should be gettable from the description
    column on =mysql.help_topic= and like?
  - [ ] Change the connections json format to make it a dict keyed with alias
    instead of array.
